# BREAKHIS_CLASSI
A hybrid transfer learning model for breast cancer classification using BreakHis 1 dataset for breast cancer classification.


With an anticipated 2.3 million new cases reported in 2020, breast cancer is the most frequent disease among women globally. Early identification and precise diagnosis are critical to improve patient outcomes, and computer-aided diagnostic technologies can help with this. The BreakHis dataset is a valuable resource for training and evaluating machine learning models for breast cancer detection.Deep learning algorithms have demonstrated extraordinary performance in a variety of picture categorization tasks, including breast cancer diagnosis. Using the BreakHis dataset, the ResNet architecture, which has been widely utilised in computer vision applications, may be used to breast cancer diagnosis. To minimise classification loss, KNN and SVM classifiers are trained using the collected features and the ADAM optimizer. On a test set, the model's performance is assessed using multiple metrics like as accuracy, precision, F1 score, Confusion matrix, and Kappa Coefficient. In a hybrid architecture, combining ResNet for feature extraction and KNN,SVM for classification may harness the capabilities of both deep learning and machine learning approaches. As a result, accuracy and performance in multiclass classification problems may improve.
